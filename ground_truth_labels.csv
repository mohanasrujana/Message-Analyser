   [Message 10 - Tina]: I've been practicing at the shooting range. I'm ready for anything. | Crime element: Actus Reus (Possessing a weapon in preparation for a crime)
   [Message 12 - Tina]: One more thing. I don't want any loose ends, understand? | Crime element: Mens Rea (Discussing elimination of potential witnesses)
   [Message 14 - Tina]: Yes, everyone who could implicate us. We need to be sure. | Crime element: Mens Rea (Planning elimination of potential witnesses)
   [Message 26 - Tina]: And what's the signal for starting our plan? | Crime element: Actus Reus (Signal for initiating a crime)
   [Message 27 - Daniel]: I'll shoot into the air three times. You know the drill. | Crime element: Actus Reus (Initiating a signal for committing a crime)
   [Message 40 - Tina]: It has to be dramatic. We need to send a message. No one will cross us again. | Crime element: Mens Rea (Planning to use violence to intimidate others)
   [Message 42 - Tina]: I'll bring the gun and extra ammo just in case. | Crime element: Actus Reus (Possessing a weapon in preparation for a crime)
   [Message 44 - Tina]: That's what you like about me, isn't it? Being able to take care of things. | Crime element: Mens Rea (Demonstrating willingness and capability to commit violent acts)
   [Message 53 - Daniel]: Agreed. See you tomorrow night then. | Crime element: Actus Reus (Meeting to commit a crime)
   [Message 59 - Daniel]: Same time, same place. Don't be late. | Crime element: Actus Reus (Meeting to commit a crime)"
195," [Message 3 - Steve]: Good thing we chose a secluded spot. I didn't want any witnesses. | Actus Reus
   [Message 7 - Steve]: Exactly. Now we just have to keep our stories straight. | Actus Reus, Mens Rea
   [Message 9 - Steve]: Right. We're both saying we were at home with our wives. | Actus Reus, Mens Rea
   [Message 13 - Steve]: I can't believe we actually did it... | Mens Rea
   [Message 15 - Steve]: And no one will ever suspect us... | Mens Rea
   [Message 17 - Steve]: Let's make sure our stories match up perfectly. | Actus Reus, Mens Rea
   [Message 19 - Steve]: If the cops start asking questions, just refer them to our alibis. | Actus Reus, Mens Rea
   [Message 21 - Steve]: Good. It's important we maintain plausible deniability. | Mens Rea
   [Message 33 - Steve]: Let's keep this between us for now. No need to spread the secret around. | Actus Reus, Mens Rea
   [Message 35 - Steve]: I look forward to keeping in touch. | Actus Reus, Mens Rea
   [Message 40 - Steve]: Until we meet again, Chris. Stay safe. | Actus Reus, Mens Rea"
196," [Message 1 - Jake]: We need to talk about last weekend. That incident on the rooftop... it didn't just happen, did it? | Crime element: Actus Reus

   [Message 3 - Jake]: We both know that's not true. Remember how we had to bring that gun with us? And then, when we saw him, it all seemed so... inevitable. | Crime element: Actus Reus

   [Message 5 - Jake]: We chose to pull that trigger, and now we have a problem on our hands. | Crime element: Actus Reus

   [Message 7 - Jake]: Maybe we can find a way to disappear for a while. | Crime element: Mens Rea

   [Message 9 - Jake]: Maybe we can find a way out of the country? | Crime element: Mens Rea

   [Message 11 - Jake]: We can always take more, if we have to. There are plenty of places in town where we can get some cash. | Crime element: Actus Reus

   [Message 13 - Jake]: It's not as impossible as it sounds. We just need to plan carefully and stick together. | Crime element: Mens Rea

   [Message 15 - Jake]: If we go to the police, they'll throw the book at us. We have a chance to escape this mess if we act now. | Crime element: Mens Rea

   [Message 17 - Jake]: A pawn shop would be perfect. They have a lot of valuables, but less security than banks. We can make it work. | Crime element: Actus Reus

   [Message 19 - Jake]: I don't want any evidence tying us to the murder. | Crime element: Actus Reus

   [Message 20 - Lily]: I'll take care of it. I know a guy who can dispose of things for cash. | Crime element: Actus Reus

   [Message 21 - Jake]: Now let's make sure we have everything we need for our escape. Money, fake IDs, and a place to go once we're out of the country. | Crime element: Mens Rea

   [Message 23 - Jake]: From now on, let's only talk in person or through encrypted messages. | Crime element: Mens Rea

   [Message 25 - Jake]: Let's say a week from tomorrow. That should give us enough time to prepare and find the perfect pawn shop. | Crime element: Mens Rea

   [Message 5 - Jake]: I'll bring the knife just in case we need it again. | Crime element: Actus Reus
   [Message 15 - Jake]: I've been doing some research and found a few options. What do you think about starting a new life in Mexico? | Crime element: Mens Rea (planning)
   [Message 23 - Jake]: I have a friend who can help us get new passports if needed. We just need to be careful not to raise any suspicions. | Crime element: Actus Reus
   [Message 25 - Jake]: I've already taken care of that. I destroyed all our old phones and bought new ones with burner SIM cards. | Crime element: Actus Reus (destroying evidence)
   [Message 27 - Jake]: I don't think it's a good idea to involve them in this, Lily. We can send them anonymous letters explaining that we had to leave suddenly and can't contact them for a while. | Crime element: Mens Rea (deception)
   [Message 30 - Lily]: Let's tell people that we went to a party at my aunt's house in another city. It's not a lie, as long as we make sure to have evidence to support our story. | Crime element: Actus Reus (lying/deception)
   [Message 32 - Lily]: And if anyone asks about the murder, we can say that we heard about it on the news and were shocked by the events. | Crime element: Mens Rea (lying/deception)"

   [Message 17 - Jake]: Good. Remember, our actions tonight could change everything for us. Let's make sure it's for the better. | Mens Rea: Expressing intent to commit a crime

   [Message 40 - Lily]: Of course, Jake. I'll always protect our secret. Even if it costs me my life. | Actus Reus: Indication that the individuals are planning to keep secrets related to their actions; Mens Rea: Acceptance of taking extreme measures to protect those secrets
   [Message 53 - Jake]: Me neither, Lily. I can already feel the weight lifting off my shoulders. | Implicit Actus Reus: Acknowledgement that the planned action will resolve a problem or issue (in this case, harming another individual)
   [Message 60 - Jake]: I agree, Jake. See you then. | Implicit Actus Reus: Indication of continued intent to follow through with the planned action"

   [Message 6 - Luke]: We'll be ready next time. We should have backup plans, just in case. | Actus Reus: Planning for future actions to cover up or commit additional crimes

   [Message 7 - Anna]: You're right. I've been thinking about a safe house. Somewhere far from here. | Actus Reus: Planning to move and hide evidence of their crime (safe house)

   [Message 8 - Luke]: That sounds wise. I know a place near the coast. No one will suspect us there. | Actus Reus: Providing a location for their safe house, possibly attempting to deceive authorities if discovered

   [Message 9 - Anna]: Good, let's arrange it soon. I don't want to risk being found out. | Mens Rea: Fear of being caught

   [Message 10 - Luke]: And remember, we need an alibi for that night. Let's create one, just in case. | Actus Reus: Planning to deceive authorities about their whereabouts on the night of the crime

   [Message 11 - Anna]: I have a friend who lives in the city. We can visit her and document our whereabouts. | Actus Reus: Providing an alibi, which may be false or misleading

   [Message 16 - Luke]: Our safe house, alibi, and backup plan should be in place soon. | Actus Reus: Planning to implement multiple actions to cover up their crime

   [Message 23 - Anna]: Let's not forget to be cautious around each other. We don't want any loose ends. | Mens Rea: Awareness of the need for secrecy and caution to avoid being caught

   [Message 27 - Anna]: It's because of what we've done that it's grown so strong. | Actus Reus: Mentioning their criminal actions as a reason for their bond (implicitly acknowledging the crime)

   [Message 33 - Anna]: Let's not forget to stay focused and cautious. We don't want to get caught. | Mens Rea: Fear of being caught

   [Message 21 - Kevin]: I thought we could go for a drive and maybe find a nice spot for our next 'bonfire'. | Actus Reus (planning for potential criminal activity)

   [Message 26 - Emma]: What should we do about the ashes? | Actus Reus (disposing of evidence)

   [Message 27 - Kevin]: Let's dispose of them in different locations, just in case. | Actus Reus (disposing of evidence)
