[Message 2 - Rachel]: Agreed, Ben. We were so careful, no one will suspect a thing.
[Message 14 - Rachel]: I took care of that too, Ben. Remember the guard's schedule we found online?
[Message 23 - Ben]: I'll edit that part out and replace it with something innocuous.
[Message 24 - Rachel]: Good thinking, Ben. I've finished cleaning up the lab too. No traces left behind.
[Message 29 - Ben]: I just saw the autopsy report. The cause of death was indeed poisoning by our concoction.
[Message 38 - Rachel]: I've already taken care of that, Ben. No one will know anything about the victim's secrets.
[Message 45 - Ben]: Excellent. Our freedom awaits us, Rach. Let's make our escape together.

[Message 3 - Ben]: How did you feel when you saw the victim collapse?

[Message 23 - Ben]: I'll edit that part out and replace it with something innocuous. It won't raise any suspicion.
[Message 25 - Ben]: Perfect. Let's wait for the autopsy report to come out. That should confirm our suspicions about the poison.
[Message 27 - Ben]: Smart move. Let's hope they don't catch on to anything soon.
[Message 28 - Rachel]: They won't, Ben. We've covered our tracks well.

[Message 31 - Ben]: Indeed it did. But we must remain cautious, Rach. We don't want to be caught.

[Message 37 - Ben]: Just one thing, Rach. What if someone starts asking questions about the victim's past?

[Message 42 - Rachel]: Me too, Ben. Our freedom is just around the corner.
[Message 43 - Ben]: Let's make sure our plan goes off without a hitch, Rach. We don't want any surprises at this point.
[Message 45 - Ben]: Excellent. Our freedom awaits us, Rach. Let's make our escape together.
